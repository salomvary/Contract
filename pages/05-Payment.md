4. Payment
==========

4.01 How Payment Works
----------------------

Once we reach an agreeable scope and cost thereof, the next issue to discuss is
payment. It's pretty simple, actually, and my reasoning behind this is actually
both to minimize the risk for myself, the developer, and to give you, the client, some peace of mind.

You, the client, will pay me at three (3) different points. Firstly, I'll need
one-third of the total cost upfront. Then, I'll need the second third after
I show you the work I've done and you've approved it. Finally, I'll need the
last third when I actually turn the code over to you (i.e. "made it live", sent it to you in an email, etc.). I do my best to be accommodating, but please understand
that I am very serious about payment (as I'm sure you are too).

Unless we arrange otherwise, I'd like to be paid by check, or cash if you're
local and want to do it that way.

4.02 Refunds and Payment Edge-Cases
-----------------------------------

Both parties (me, the developer, and you, the client) may, at any point in the
term of the project, withdraw our involvement for any reason. This
may occur, for instance, if the scope of the project changes to the degree that I am no longer
confident in my ability to do the work in a way that makes sense for me
financially. And this rare event will undoubtedly happen after several
conversations and an unwillingness on the part of the client to accommodate the
financial consequences of a change in scope. In short, be nice to me and I'll
happily do the job you pay me to do.

If this happens, I'm confident that we can work out some sort of deal by which
I get paid for a portion of the work completed, and you receive the portion of
my work that you paid for. Or, perhaps, we both just decide to call it even.

I will under no circumstances release the source
code of my work to you, the client, without receiving some sort of
compensation. To me, this just makes sense; you don't get the goods without payment. Neither of us is unreasonable, so, again, be nice to me and I'll
do everything I can to make sure you are a happy client.

There is one exception, however: time billed as "Project Management" (i.e. client meetings and phone calls, preparing documents, communicating via online tools) is non-refundable. If we both agree to part ways, for whatever reason, you must still pay me for project management time. Sorry, but I've been burned in the past by clients who spend a lot of time planning only to pull the plug at the last minute. You know the type.

4.03 Legal Stuff
----------------

As I mentioned before, I am very serious about payment. It is how I am able to
continue doing what I love to do for a living. (Hopefully) without sounding
negative, if you, the client, refuse to pay me for whatever reason (assuming
that I have completed the services as scoped), I will take legal action to
ensure that I am paid. If the case is decided in my favor, you agree to
reimburse me for any legal fees I accrue in the process.
