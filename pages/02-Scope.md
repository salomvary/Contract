1. Scope
========

1.01 About the Project Scope
----------------------------

Before I begin development on your project, I'll want to, over the course over
several conversations, develop a scope for the project. If you are unfamiliar,
a project scope is simply a document that details exactly the work I will be doing for
you.

It's kind of like a blueprint for a house: you don't want to build a house
off the cuff, making decisions as you go. You will likely end up with a house
that is structurally unsound, or worse. The same applies here: before we begin
the project, I need to know exactly what I'm building so that I can plan it out
properly.

The project scope (and adherence to it) protects both of us. It is the document
that we can look to if there is any dispute over whether a certain feature is
or isn't in the budget. It is essentially part two of this contract.

1.02 My Thoughts on Scope
-------------------------

I like to adhere to a more Agile definition of project scope. That is to say,
I do not fear changes to the scope. In fact, I expect that, as we start
building, your ideas may change; that's sort of how people work. And rather
than choosing to ignore the fact that this happens often in software development, I prefer to embrace the fact and be upfront about it. So you, the client, must understand that
changes to the scope can (and usually will) affect the timeline and budget of
the project.

If you would like to change something in the scope of the project, just let me
know and I will (usually) gladly accommodate.

1.03 Making Changes to the Scope
----------------------------------

Easy as pie. Simply contact me and we can discuss it. Please do keep in mind,
as I mentioned above, that scope changes will/may affect the budget or timeline
of your project, and that this choice is yours to make.
