## 3.01 Bugfixing and Other Issues

Unfortunately, bugs happen in software development. As much as I could promise
that my code will be bug-free, the truth of the matter is that all code has
bugs regardless of what the developer says.

That doesn't mean, however, that I am not dedicated to providing good quality, working code. To the best of my ability, I will create bug-free code, and work hard to correct my code that is not.

Regarding bugfixes:
* I am happy to fix bugs that I determine to be due to a mistake I made free of charge.
* I assume no responsibility for bugs that are not due to the code I write. I am, therefore, not obligated to fix said bugs. However, if the bug is determined to be an issue in the framework used (Drupal, etc), I will fix it at my normal hourly rate if we make such an agreement.
* Bugs are not the same as changes to the scope.

## 3.02 Legal Issues

I cannot be held legally responsible for lost sales, profits, or conversions
that you incur due to a bug in the code I write. Unfortunately, it is not
feasible for me to offer this sort of insurance, though I will do my best to resolve
the bug as quickly as possible so that you do not incur further losses.
