This is my no nonsense, plain language freelance contract.

You can use it if you want, but please remove all details relevant to my business.

Build
-----
Run `make build` (or just `make`). It requires Ruby and the Markdown and HTMLDOC command line tools (`brew install markdown htmldoc` should do it on a Mac).

Legal
-----
I'm not a lawyer, and make no promises that this contract will work for you.
I assume no responsibility for any legal or other issues you may face as
a result of using this contract. YMMV.
